This project was to create an asteroids game from scratch in Java. Asteroids is a 2D game where you control a spaceship that must destory asteroids flying at it to survive. This game includes multiple levels of increasing difficulty, with random backgrounds and stage items in each, where you must destroy all asteroids to progress to the next level. Asteroids split into multiplle fragments when they are destroyed, which fly in different directions to confuse the player. I also implemented a few basic AI bot spaceships that try to attack the player and have distinct behaviours, that range from flying straight at the player to trying to avoid the player at all costs. Multiple power ups are included that can be obtained from destroyed asteroids to enhance the players abilities and can conserve the players limited lives. The game includes two difficulties, the easier of which includes a shield for the player that recharges after a few seconds of not being damaged.

I have included a video of the gameplay in this repository.
